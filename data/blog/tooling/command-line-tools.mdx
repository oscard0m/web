Today is Sunday and I decided I wanted to take a look into some of the Command-Line tools written in Rust out there. Some of them have a lot of stars ⭐ on GitHub so I have a good feeling these will be tools I will enjoy as a user and will improve my productivity as well.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a programming language [I want to get involved with](/previously/2022-08) and I come up with the idea of integrating some Command Line tools written in Rust in my day to day could be a good opportunity to get in touch with them as a user and, from there, maybe getting involved opening a new issue or drafting a Pull Request, why not!

Here's the list of Command-Line tools I installed today in my personal computer:

- [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A cat(1) clone with wings. It offers _Syntax highlighting_ and _Git integration_
- [`bandwhich`](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich): A terminal bandwidth utilization tool. This is a CLI utility for displaying current network utilization by process, connection and remote IP/hostname.
- [`bottom`](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom): A customizable cross-platform graphical process/system monitor for the terminal.
- [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): A syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output.
- [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust): A more intuitive version of du in Rust.
- [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa): A modern replacement for `ls`.
- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to 'find'.
- [`hyperfine`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine): A command-line benchmarking tool.
- [`prox`](https://github.com/dalance/procs): A modern replacement for `ps` written in Rust.
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): `ripgrep` recursively searches directories for a RegEx pattern while respecting your `.gitignore`. Similar to other popular search tools like `The Silver Searcher`, `ack` and `grep`.
- [`sd`](https://github.com/chmln/sd): Intuitive find & replace CLI (`sed` alternative).
- [`tealdeer`](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer): A very fast implementation of [`tldr`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) in Rust. A more approachable complement to traditional [`man pages`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

Some of these tools promise to give **a better performance ⚡** than the common UNIX commands they are replacing to. Others they just **expand its functionality** and **improves the coloring 🌈 and presentation of the outputs** which is something I'm already enjoying.

To make them have more traction I added some `aliases` in my `.bash_profile` to make sure I use them in my daily work. Here's the snippet of bash just in case you want to apply the same aliases I did:

```bash
defineAlias () {
   type "$2" >/dev/null 2>&1 && alias "$1"="$2"
}

defineAlias cat bat
defineAlias ls exa
defineAlias top btm
defineAlias du dust
defineAlias find fd
defineAlias ps procs
defineAlias grep rg
defineAlias sed sd
```

The `defineAlias()` function makes sure to not define the alias if the command does not exist. This is very useful in case we decide to uninstall one of this tools and we forget to remove the alias from our bash profile. I found this snippet of code in [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34391838/best-way-to-define-conditional-aliases-in-shell).
