This month in **TMIL** (_This Month I've learned_) I want to share with you the outcome I produced from reviewing the fundamentals module of [Epic React: rendering Arrays"](https://epicreact.dev/learn):

- [**ðŸ““ Notes**](#notes): Some annotations, discoveries or thoughts while going through this module.
- [**ðŸ“š Resources**](#resources): Interesting articles / documentation / repositories I took a deep look into while going through this module.
- [**ðŸ’¡ðŸ—’ Blog ideas**](#blog-ideas): Ideas to blog posts I had while going through this module. To explain these concepts with my own words will consolidate my JS/web/React knowledge and I will train my writing skills at the same time.

This blog post pretends to be used as a personal knowledge database but, at the same time, it would be awesome if somebody else can learn something from it. Enjoy!
