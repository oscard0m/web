This month in **TMIL** (_This Month I've learned_) I want to share with you the outcome I produced from reviewing the fundamentals module of [Epic React: Intro to raw React APIs"](https://epicreact.dev/learn):

- [**ðŸ““ Notes**](#notes): Some annotations, discoveries or thoughts while going through this module.
- [**ðŸ“š Resources**](#resources): Interesting articles / documentation / repositories I took a deep look into while going through this module.
- [**ðŸ’¡ðŸ—’ Blog ideas**](#blog-ideas): Ideas to blog posts I had while going through this module. To explain these concepts with my own words will consolidate my JS/web/React knowledge and I will train my writing skills at the same time.

This blog post pretends to be used as a personal knowledge database but, at the same time, it would be awesome if somebody else can learn something from it. Enjoy!

## Notes

- [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) utility for fast, global content delivery network
  for everything on npm.

## Resources

## Blog ideas

Here are some ideas I got as potential blog posts:

- [Whats the difference between `React.createElement(element, {children: [elem1, elem2]})` and `React.createElement(element, null, elem1, elem2)`?](https://github.com/oscard0m/web/issues/94)
