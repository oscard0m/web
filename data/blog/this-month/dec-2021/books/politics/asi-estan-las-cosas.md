This month in **TMIR** (_This Month I've read_) I want to share with you the outcome I produced from reading the book [Así están las cosas: Cómo ganamos en Europa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49439298-as-est-n-las-cosas) by [Gonzalo Boye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Boye):

- [**📓 Notes**](#notes): Some annotations, discoveries or thoughts while going through this book.
- [**📚 Resources**](#resources): Interesting articles / podcasts / blog posts I took a deep look into while going through this book.
- [**💡🗒 Blog ideas**](#blog-ideas): Ideas to blog posts I had while going through this book. To explain these concepts with my own words will consolidate my tips and takes about the independence of Catalonia conflict and I will train my writing skills at the same time.

This blog post pretends to be used as a personal knowledge database but, at the same time, it would be awesome if somebody else can learn something from it. Enjoy!
