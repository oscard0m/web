This month in **TMIR** (_This Month I've read_) I want to share with you the outcome I produced from reading the book [Independízate del Papá Estado: Empieza a invertir HOY y jubílate millonario](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24983640-independ-zate-de-pap-estado) by [Carlos Galán](https://carlosgalan.net/):

- [**📓 Notes**](#notes): Some annotations, discoveries or thoughts while going through this book.
- [**📚 Resources**](#resources): Interesting articles / podcasts / blog posts I took a deep look into while going through this book.
- [**💡🗒 Blog ideas**](#blog-ideas): Ideas to blog posts I had while going through this book. To explain these concepts with my own words will consolidate my knowledge in investment and index funds and I will train my writing skills at the same time.

This blog post pretends to be used as a personal knowledge database but, at the same time, it would be awesome if somebody else can learn something from it. Enjoy!
