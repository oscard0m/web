This month in **TMIR** (_This Month I've read_) I want to share with you the outcome I produced from reading the book [One Life: How we forgot to live meaningful lives](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48725742-one-life) by [Morten AlbÃ¦k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Alb%C3%A6k):

- [**ðŸ““ Notes**](#notes): Some annotations, discoveries or thoughts while going through this book.
- [**ðŸ“š Resources**](#resources): Interesting articles / podcasts / blog posts I took a deep look into while going through this book.
- [**ðŸ’¡ðŸ—’ Blog ideas**](#blog-ideas): Ideas to blog posts I had while going through this book. To explain these concepts with my own words will consolidate my tipcs and takes about living a meaningful life and I will train my writing skills at the same time.

This blog post pretends to be used as a personal knowledge database but, at the same time, it would be awesome if somebody else can learn something from it. Enjoy!
