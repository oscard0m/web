This month in **TMIL** (_This Month I've learned_) I want to share with you the outcome I produced from reviewing the fundamentals module of [Epic React: Basic JS "Hello World"](https://epicreact.dev/learn):

- [**ðŸ““ Notes**](#notes): Some annotations, discoveries or thoughts while going through this module.
- [**ðŸ“š Resources**](#resources): Interesting articles / documentation / repositories I took a deep look into while going through this module.
- [**ðŸ’¡ðŸ—’ Blog ideas**](#blog-ideas): Ideas to blog posts I had while going through this module. To explain these concepts with my own words will consolidate my JS/web/React knowledge and I will train my writing skills at the same time.

This blog post pretends to be used as a personal knowledge database but, at the same time, it would be awesome if somebody else can learn something from it. Enjoy!

## Notes

`<script type="module">`: The good news is that modern browsers have started to support module functionality natively, and this is what this article is all about. This can only be a good thing â€” browsers can optimize loading of modules, making it more efficient than having to use a library and do all of that extra client-side processing and extra round trips.

## Resources

Here are some good articles/documentation entries I took a look into while going through this exercise. It refreshed and complemented my knowledge about the how the Browser works with HTML and how JavaScript modules work.

- [MDN: What is the DOM?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
- [MDN: JS Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
- [JS Modules examples](https://github.com/mdn/js-examples/tree/master/modules)

## Blog ideas

Here are some ideas I got as potential blog posts:

- [What's the difference between `Element.append()` and `Node.appendChild()`?](https://github.com/oscard0m/web/issues/90)
- [Understanding JS modules](https://github.com/oscard0m/web/issues/91)
